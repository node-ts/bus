# @node-ts/bus

@node-ts/bus is a node-based library that aims to simplify the development of resilient message-based applications. By handling the technical aspects of the underlying bus transport, it enables developers to focus on creating loosely coupled systems with less boilerplate.

@node-ts/bus allows developers to specify messages and message handlers. It then manages the message transport, subscriptions, and retries behind the scenes. In case of failure, messages are returned to the queue for retry, promoting application resilience.

Additionally, the library provides message workflows, or sagas, to help developers coordinate multiple messages and handlers in longer running processes. As a result, applications built with @node-ts/bus can be more robust, self-healing, and resistant to data loss or corruption.
